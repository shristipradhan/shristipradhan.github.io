Hello! Welcome to my home page!

I'm passionate about technology and love to develop engineering solutions to solve real world problems. My interests are in Internet of Things (IoT) application, Aritificial Intelligence (AI), embedded systems, wireless communications. 

I'm a Software Engineer currently working at [Sierra Wireless](https://www.sierrawireless.com/), Vancouver, Canada. I'm working on open source embedded platform to enable IoT application development on Linux and Real Time Operating System (RTOS). My past experience include developing software for Internet Protocol Router at Ericsson Inc. and BlackBerry smartphones at BlackBerry Ltd.

I completed Master's of Applied Science degree from [Electrical and Computer Engineering department](https://www.ece.ubc.ca/) at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. During my Master's research, I developed resource optimization methods for small cells or heterogeneous wireless networks. 

I studied Bachelor's of Engineering from [Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering](https://doece.pcampus.edu.np/) at Tribhuvan University, Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus, Nepal. While working as a researcher in Nepal, I contributed to the establishment of remote sensing data centre at the Faculty of Technology in Nepal Academy of Science and Technology.

My hobbies are to travel, hike and play badminton. A latest addition to my hobby is to cook different culinary cuisines. To name a few cities that I've loved traveling to are London, Stuttgart, Tokyo, Kyoto, Hong Kong, San Francisco, Boston and ... (looking forward to travel more!) I've lived in Kathmandu, Vancouver and Waterloo. Some of my favourite spots to hike are Banff, Squamish, Garibaldi and Whistler in Canada.
