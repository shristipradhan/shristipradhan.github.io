Greetings! Welcome to my homepage!

Tech professional with a passion for engineering innovative solutions that address real-world challenges, I thrive at the intersection of cutting-edge technologies. My expertise lies in crafting solutions for embedded systems, Internet of Things (IoT) applications and wireless communications. My journey has been marked by a keen interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology.

Currently, I'm in Silicon Valley!  I worked as Senior Embedded Software Engineer at Schneider Electric, writing code for supervisory controller and communications card which is the central intelligence unit for Schneider's home energy management system. In my previous role as Senior Software Engineer at Sierra Wireless, I contributed to an open-source embedded platform aimed at empowering IoT application development on both Linux and Real-Time Operating System (RTOS). Prior experiences include software development for Internet Protocol Routers at Ericsson and BlackBerry smartphones at BlackBerry.

I earned my Master's of Applied Science degree from the [Electrical and Computer Engineering department](https://www.ece.ubc.ca/) at the University of British Columbia (UBC), Vancouver, BC, focusing on resource optimization methods for small cells in heterogeneous wireless networks. 

My academic journey began with a Bachelor's in Engineering from the [Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering](https://doece.pcampus.edu.np/) at Tribhuvan University, Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus, Nepal. 

During my time in Nepal, I played a crucial role in establishing a remote sensing data center at the Faculty of Technology in Nepal Academy of Science and Technology.

Beyond my professional endeavors, I find joy in traveling, hiking, and playing badminton. Some cities that have left a lasting impression on me include London, Stuttgart, Tokyo, Kyoto, Hong Kong, Montreal, San Francisco, and Boston, with a growing list as I look forward to more adventures! My favorite hiking spots include Banff, Squamish, Garibaldi, and Whistler in BC, Canada. 

Explore further with me as I continue to embrace new experiences and challenges on this exciting journey!
