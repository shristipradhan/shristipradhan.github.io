Hello, welcome to my homepage!

I'm passionate about technology and love to develop engineering solutions to solve real world problems. My interests are in Internet of Things (IoT) application, Aritificial Intelligence (AI), embedded systems, wireless communications. 

I'm a Software Engineer at [Sierra Wireless](https://www.sierrawireless.com/), Vancouver, Canada. I'm working on open source embedded platform to enable IoT application development. My past experience include developing software for IP Router at Ericsson Inc. and BlackBerry phones at BlackBerry Ltd.

I did my Master's of Applied Science from [Electrical and Computer Engineering department](https://www.ece.ubc.ca/) at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. I completed my Bachelor's of Engineering from [Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering](https://doece.pcampus.edu.np/) at Tribhuvan University, Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus, Nepal.

During my Master's research, I developed resource optimization methods for small cells or heterogeneous networks in wireless communications. While working in Nepal, I contributed to the establishment of remote sensing data centre at the Faculty of Technology, Nepal Academy of Science and Technology.

I love to hike and travel. I've traveled in about 10 countries. My latest hobby is cooking different culinary cuisines. :)
