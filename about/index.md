Greetings! Welcome to my homepage!

Tech professional with a passion for engineering innovative solutions that address real-world challenges, I thrive at the intersection of cutting-edge technologies. My expertise lies in crafting solutions for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, embedded systems, and wireless communications. My journey has been marked by a keen interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology.

Currently serving as a Senior Embedded Software Designer at Schneider Electric in the tech hub of Vancouver. In my previous role as Senior Software Engineer at Sierra Wireless, I contributed to an open-source embedded platform aimed at empowering IoT application development on both Linux and Real-Time Operating System (RTOS). Prior experiences include software development for Internet Protocol Routers at Ericsson Inc. and BlackBerry smartphones at BlackBerry Ltd.

I earned my Master's of Applied Science degree from the [Electrical and Computer Engineering department]((https://www.ece.ubc.ca/)) at the University of British Columbia (UBC), focusing on resource optimization methods for small cells in heterogeneous wireless networks. 

My academic journey began with a Bachelor's in Engineering from the [Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering](https://doece.pcampus.edu.np/) at Tribhuvan University, Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus, Nepal. 

During my time in Nepal, I played a crucial role in establishing a remote sensing data center at the Faculty of Technology in Nepal Academy of Science and Technology.

Beyond my professional endeavors, I find joy in traveling, hiking, and playing badminton. Some cities that have left a lasting impression on me include London, Stuttgart, Tokyo, Kyoto, Hong Kong, San Francisco, and Boston, with a growing list as I look forward to more adventures! My favorite hiking spots include Banff, Squamish, Garibaldi, and Whistler in Canada. 

Explore further with me as I continue to embrace new experiences and challenges on this exciting journey!
