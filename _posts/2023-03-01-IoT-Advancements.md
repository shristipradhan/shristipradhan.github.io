My role at [Sierra Wireless](https://www.sierrawireless.com/) revolved around elevating Internet of Things (IoT) development. My work spanned various facets, from designing cellular mesh networks to the enhancement of the open-source [Legato Application Framework](http://legato.io), with a relentless commitment to simplifying and streamlining the IoT development process.

# Key Contribution

## Cellular Mesh Network Development

Engineered a control plane agent as a pivotal component of a cellular mesh network project. Utilizing Python, Raspberry Pi, cellular, and Wi-SUN technologies, the control plane agent was instrumental in orchestrating core system state transitions and ensuring seamless interaction with the cloud. The primary objective was to craft a compelling proof of concept that effectively showcased the synergistic advantages of integrating both cellular and mesh networks within a self-organizing framework. The resulting demonstration successfully illustrated the practical applications of this innovative solution across diverse user stories, emphasizing the transformative potential of dynamic, interconnected networks.

## Edge Application Framework Enhancement

- Developed and implemented abstraction layers using C and C++ within the Legato framework. This innovation resulted in a remarkable 60% reduction in development time for over 100 companies worldwide, facilitating the seamless creation of IoT applications.
- As the scrum master for a dynamic team of 10 engineers, I played a pivotal role in ensuring the timely delivery of Legato releases for Linux modules. This included overseeing the incorporation of new IoTKeystore features, fortifying security measures and ensuring secure data migration.

## ThreadX RTOS Bringup

Designed and developed core features in C operating on the ThreadX Real-Time Operating System (RTOS). This enabled platform services for networking, cellular connectivity, and data management, ultimately reducing the total cost of ownership by around 40%.

## Device Driver Optimization

Optimized device driver code by introducing a kernel module dependency resolver feature, resulting in a significant 50% reduction in development time.

## Backend Development for Build Tools

Created a backend for new build and development tools using C++, seamlessly integrated into the Visual Studio Code IDE Legato plugin. This automation of definition files drastically cut down IoT development time from 2-3 hours to an efficient 2-3 minutes.

## Open Source Contribution
