Nepal is recognized as an agricultural economy, however, the country suffers from acute food shortage especially during the dry season. I initiated a team in my university in Nepal to collaborate with international universities to solve some commonly faced problems by rural communities in Nepal. These however were challenging engineering problems, requiring creative thinking. We initially started with 6 student members and grew to around 20 team members. Our international team comprised of three universities: Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk, Nepal; Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan and University of Oslo, Norway.

Our team designed a food preservation system comprising of underground storage system, temperature and  humidity control system. We focused on solving the food security problem, inducing economic development and providing an environmentally friendly solution for food storage.

I had the opportunity to represent the project at the Mondialogo Symposium 2009 at Stuttgart, Germany (Mondialogo was an initiative of Daimler and UNESCO). I along with Ben Allan, Japan team member presented our ideas on solving the food security problem of rural communities in Nepal. The project idea was honoured with Mondialogo Engineering Gold Award 2008/09. The project proposal was selected among 932 submitted project ideas and awarded monetary prize of â‚¬15,000. The project actively contributed to the application of engineering sciences and the global pursuit of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (food security, poverty reduction and environmental protection).

I presented to a group of students in Vancouver, Canada about our project in an informal setting. You can view the presentation [here](https://www.slideshare.net/shristipradhan1/food-p).
