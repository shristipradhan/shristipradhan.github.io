My latest work at [Sierra Wireless](https://www.sierrawireless.com/) is developing features for open source Legato Application framework [Legato](http://legato.io) to simplify embedded Internet of Things (IoT) development.

Summary of areas that I'm contributing:
- Bring up various platform services on ThreadX RTOS.
- Design and develop a vertically integrated loadable kernel module dependency resolver feature on Linux.
- Implement new build and development tools to enhance Legato usability.
