It was an honour to work as a researcher at the Faculty of Technology of Nepal Academy of Science and Technology (NAST) after my Bachelor's study. I contributed to research grant proposal for establishing a data centre for remote sensing applications. A work plan was developed, and servers and workstations were deployed in the research facility to analyze the remote sensing data.

Our vision of establishing a data centre in NAST was to integrate ongoing projects within NAST and initiate collaboration with national and international organizations. Also, an important goal was to create a resource centre where educators, researchers and scientists around the globe could collaborate.[Presentation here.](https://www.slideshare.net/shristipradhan1/establishment-of-remote-sensing-data-centre-in-nast)
