In Summer 2013, I spent a work term in BlackBerry Limited headquarters in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. It was an awesome experience working as WLAN-LTE Test Development Engineer Intern with the Radio Frequency (RF) Connectivity and Radio Coexistence Platform team.

The team comprise of creative engineers who provide leading edge reference designs of RF connectivity radios, such as WLAN, Bluetooth, GPS, FM, NFC, etc., and their coexistence wireless Wide Area Network (WAN) radios, such as LTE, W-CDMA, CDMA/EVDO, GSM/EDGE, etc., for BlackBerry handheld and tablet devices.

I worked in the following areas:

1. WLAN and WLAN-LTE throughput testing:

Developed a test automation software mainly in Python programming language.

Performed tests and analyzed the performance of BlackBerry smartphones (Q10, Z10) using the software system I built.

2. Bidirectional WLAN automated throughput testing (uplink and downlink):

Worked on the standard IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac.

Successfully automated both uplink and downlink WLAN throughput testing. Software modules were developed in Python.

Incorporated features on software user interface such as setting up different uplink and downlink path loss values of Agilent attenuators.

3. LTE-WLAN coexistence analysis:

Studied the coexistence behaviour between LTE and WLAN for BlackBerry Q10, Z10.

Debugged issues in the performance of the coexistence software.

Provided solutions to solve the interference problems between LTE and WiFi signals and to improve the performance of BlackBerry Q10, Z10.

Overall, it was a great learning experience! :)
